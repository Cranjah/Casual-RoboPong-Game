Dear User,


First of all you must be sure, that Python3 is installed properly on
your computer including the package management tool PyPi:

Visit https://www.python.org/ for instructions and further downloads; 

I'm using the following libraries in my final project via import, so
please make sure they are all installed on your system:

pygame

You can in case install the libraries via pip install command in your
terminal window, following this command patterns:

CMD: pip install pygame

or for macOS:
CMD: pip3 install pygame

Also make sure you download the public repository properly via GitHub
and especially make sure you download the file "project.py" as well
as the dependency folders "images" and "sounds"!

All of the mentioned above must be in the same directory of your PC.

Depending on your own operating system you first need to compile it;

To start the program in your terminal, please open the folder, which
contains the program, in your terminal and run one of these commands:

CMD: python project.py

or for macOS:
CMD: python3 project.py

This command should run a classical game of Pong or so-called RoboPong!
It's a two-player-game, use the keys W and S for movements of player 1
and the arrow keys UP and DOWN for movements of player 2.

I hope you have a lot of fun playing this game - like me coding it. :-)

Kindest Regards,


Marc-Michel MÃ¼nch
